    <h1>Our Legacy</h1>
    <p>Founded in 1929 as a small textile shop in Kolar, Karnataka, our family business has grown over four generations into a 24,000 sq. ft. fashion destination in the heart of the city.</p>
    <p>From humble beginnings, we’ve become a trusted name for quality, style, and value.</p>
    <p>Today, we proudly offer a one-stop shopping experience for the entire family – from wedding silk sarees, fashion sarees, and premium suitings & shirtings to women’s ethnic and western wear, and men’s collections from leading brands.</p>
    <p>With quality as our top priority and affordable pricing at the core of our philosophy, we continue to serve generations of families with the same trust and dedication that began nearly a century ago.</p>
